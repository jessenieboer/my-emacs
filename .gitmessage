# changetypes
#   ddoc :: docs for developers
#   dep :: dependencies
#   exp :: experimental (no functional new feature yet)
#   feat :: new chunk of functionality
#     - perhaps include user-facing message in body for auto docs?
#   fix :: something was broken
#   perf :: performance
#   ref :: refactoring only; no new feature
#   src :: source control stuff
#   style :: code style, comments, etc...
#   test :: testing stuff only
#   udoc :: user documentation
# scopes
#   (none so far)
# summary
#   - start with capitol letter
#   - present, imperative tense
#   - no period at end
#   - in some cases, maybe the changetype is enough of a summary
# body
#   - explain why
